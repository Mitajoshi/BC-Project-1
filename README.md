Project Description/Outline
 The goal for this group project is to fetch movie data from multiple sources, clean the data, merge it together, and look for correlations based on rating, time, gross, and actors, then represent that data through strong visualizations.


Tasks
Fetch movie data set through API call and clean the data
Identify movies by their ID# and fetch details about the movies 
Create a master data frame for further analysis
Obtain Oscar awards dataset and import that into a dataframe
Merge above data frames around Movie name & release year
Add iMDB ratings column to Oscar dataframe
Then merge above dataframe with Oscar dataframe for further analysis
Store image plots to png file
Identify international winner over past decade(or longer duration) and obtain the winning country’s lat-lng of the capital [obtain coords via API call]
Map those cities on world map 
Create presentation deck
Analysis Report


Research Questions to Answer
Incorporate boxplots to identify outliers for budget or some such similar quantifier towards movie’s success
Some angle on the genre of the movie - some analysis: over time what genres have gotten more popular and which ones are less popular over time.
Correlation between profitability and actor names. 
Find correlation between budget & popularity or box office earnings
Find correlation between iMDB rating & movies that receive Oscar awards 
Identify international winner over past decade(or longer duration based on available data) 
Identify 10-15 movies which have 10/10 iMDB rating and locate their origin country on map and print the capital city points on the world map
Identify movies that won both Oscar & Academy awards and try to find the factor that most influenced their success
What kind of movie user would like to watch? 
Correlate runtime of movies with popularity/box office earnings 
Group the rows in dataframe by country name and Map them on the worldmap
